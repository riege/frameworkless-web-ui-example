            This is where we bind the view (our custom components)
            to the model that is defined in the script tag below.

            The example-view is a static component that adds
            a header and a box containing its content.

            The counter-view is a custom component defined in
            counter_view.js. The model attribute is used in all
            components that make use of data binding to define
            which part of the state tree a view should bind to.

            The state tree for this page is defined further below
            in a script tag.

            the same architecture for unidirectional data flow.

        It's a best practice to put script tags at the bottom of the
        HTML. This is because script tags can block the browser from
        rendering the HTML.

    <!--
        The immer library currently doesn't distribute browser-compatible ES6 modules,
        so we use the UMD build, which is then wrapped into a module
        in src/deps/immer.js, which includes a more detailed explanation.

        We use a module to initialize our model

        This is necessary because only a module can import other modules.

            to a immutable copy of that object. Other examples use the same
